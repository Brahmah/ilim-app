**Please note:** This app is developed and maintained by an Ilim student incorporating feedback from fellow students to provide the best possible experience to accessing schools learning systems.

# **Version 0.3.0**
Just updating a little code here and there. It ain't much, but it's honest work.

- Improved overall staff experience.
- Implemented push notifications one day and a week before an excursion or incursion.
- Added whiteboard scan functionality for staff accounts.
- Revamped Share Sheet. One can now send attachments and images from outside the app to social streams. This is in addition to the existing share sheet ‘my files’ support.
- Redesigned subject detail and homepage views to dynamically present students with the most relevant info at the best time from both college LMS systems
- Altered app colour scheme to be more inline with that of the college.
- Added individual class/group social stream view.

All these changes were requested by users just like yourself, feel free to suggest anything or report bugs in the settings page. Thank you.
