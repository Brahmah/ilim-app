# INCLASS Privacy Policy

INCLASS ("INCLASS", "we", "us", "our") is committed to safeguarding your privacy. This Privacy Policy applies to all of our apps, services, and websites (collectively, the "Services") and explains how we collect, use, and share information about you when you use our Services.

In this Privacy Policy, we reference the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) and the Privacy and Data Protection Act 2014 (Vic) (collectively, the "Privacy Laws") as applicable to our collection, use, and disclosure of your personal information.

When you use our Services, we do not collect any personal information or sensitive personal information. This means that we do not collect information such as your name, email address, phone number, or other contact information, as well as any sensitive information such as financial or health information.

We may collect information about your use of our Services, such as the features you use, the content you view, and the actions you take. This information may include your IP address, device identifier, and other technical information. We may also collect information from third-party sources, such as TelemetryDeck, to help us improve and operate our Services. This information may include anonymized telemetry data and other non-personal information.

In some cases, we may collect a notification token to be able to send notifications to your device. This information is not linked to any personal information and is only used for the purpose of providing the Services to you.
We make all requests directly to your school's servers (such as Schoolbox) and only use our servers to provide instance configuration and serve content to devices using our app. We do not store or process your school data off-device.

We use the information we collect to provide, maintain, and improve our Services, as well as to communicate with you and respond to your requests. We may also use the information for research and analytics purposes, to help us understand how our Services are used and to make them more useful and effective.

We do not collect any personal information, and therefore do not share it with third parties for their own marketing or advertising purposes without your consent. We may share your the minimal information we do collect with third parties in other limited circumstances, such as when required by law or to protect the safety, rights, or property of INCLASS or others. However, this will only include device identifiers and requests for config as nothing else is collected.

All of your requests and queries are directed to your college's servers with no intermediate party involved. We are committed to maintaining a safe, cutting-edge, and secure app for our schools and their students.

We take reasonable measures to protect the security of your personal information, including the use of encryption and other safeguards when transmitting or storing your information. However, no security measures are perfect and we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your information.

If you have any questions or concerns about our Privacy Policy or the way we handle your personal information, please contact us at support@inclass.com.

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time, so please review it periodically for any changes. We will post notice of any changes on this page and, if the changes are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice (including, for certain Services, email notification of privacy policy changes). By continuing to use our Services after any changes become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised Privacy Policy.
