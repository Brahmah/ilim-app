# Privacy Policy

**Please note:** This app is in no way affliated with schoolbox or academium and is merely developed and maintained by a student incorporating feedback from fellow students to provide the best possible experience to accessing schools learning systems.

Ultimately, all information collected through this app makes it's way to the college. The app does NOT collect or transmit sensitive data in any way to a third party except through LMS systems authorized and maintained by the college. 

Some diagnostic information is locally logged and transmitted in some instances where we believe crashes or issues are occuring. These logs do not contain any sensitive information and are largely generic. Very minimal telemetry is used but is completely anonymous. See the [TelemetryDeck Privacy Policy for more](https://telemetrydeck.com/pages/privacy-policy.html)

Depending on the configuration of your college Schoolbox instance, an external server may be used to handle the sending of push notifications. If you have any concerns, don't hessitate to contact us. 

By using this app, you're (obviously) subject to the privacy policy of your college.
